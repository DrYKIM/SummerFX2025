        <h1>Common Findings on Racial Health Disparities</h1>
        <p>
            Understanding racial health disparities is crucial for developing equitable public health interventions. Our questionnaire aims to explore common perceptions and then compare them with established data. Below are some general findings often observed in health outcomes across different racial and ethnic groups, along with references to common areas of disparity.
        </p>

        <h2>Diabetes Prevalence</h2>
        <p>
            Data consistently shows higher rates of diagnosed diabetes among certain racial and ethnic minority groups compared to White, non-Hispanic individuals. For instance, in the United States:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-Hispanic Black adults are 60% more likely than non-Hispanic White adults to be diagnosed with diabetes.</li>
            <li>Hispanic adults are 70% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes compared to non-Hispanic White adults.</li>
            <li>American Indian/Alaska Native adults have the highest rates of diagnosed diabetes among all racial/ethnic groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These disparities are influenced by a complex interplay of socioeconomic factors, access to healthcare, environmental conditions, and systemic inequities.
        </p>

        <h2>Cardiovascular Disease</h2>
        <p>
            Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including heart disease and stroke, also exhibit significant racial disparities.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>African Americans have higher rates of hypertension (high blood pressure) and develop it earlier in life, often with more severe consequences.</li>
            <li>Mortality rates from heart disease and stroke are higher for Black adults compared to White adults.</li>
            <li>Disparities in access to quality care, healthy food options, and safe environments contribute to these differences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Self-Reported Health Status</h2>
        <p>
            Self-reported health is a strong predictor of future health outcomes and often reflects an individual's overall well-being and access to resources.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups are often more likely to report fair or poor health status compared to White individuals.</li>
            <li>This can be linked to chronic stress from discrimination, lower socioeconomic status, and poorer living conditions, all of which impact perceived health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Asthma Prevalence and Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
            Asthma is another condition where racial disparities are evident, particularly in urban environments.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Black and Puerto Rican children have disproportionately higher rates of asthma prevalence, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths due to asthma.</li>
            <li>Factors contributing to these disparities include exposure to environmental triggers (e.g., air pollution, substandard housing), limited access to specialists, and inadequate management of the condition.</li>
        </ul>
