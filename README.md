# SummerFX2025 Project

Welcome to the SummerFX2025 repository! This repository contains materials and exercises for our summer program.

## Day 1 Activities

On Day 1, we will begin by checking student understanding of racial disparities in health through a survey questionnaire. Please use the following link to answer the survey:
[Racial Health Disparities Survey](https://forms.gle/vgiRgibEWrwiT9oD6)

After the survey, I will introduce RStudio and walk through the introductory worksheet:
[R Introduction: Basic Coding and Practice](https://drykim.github.io/SummerFX2025/R_Intro.html)

Following my session, students will discuss health disparity issues further after reading the common findings:
[Common Findings on Racial Health Disparities](https://drykim.github.io/SummerFX2025/Common_Finding.html)

A research mentor will also be available to ensure every student can follow the R Intro, and can successfully import and create tables when given data and variable names.

## Day 2 Activities

The Day 2 worksheet will be used as the main worksheet for Day 2. You can access it here:
[Day 2 Worksheet (Live Page)](https://drykim.github.io/SummerFX2025/day2.html)

After you finish, you can analyze another variable, CVDINFR4, which indicates heart attack status. Please refer to the step-by-step guide for data analysis provided in the link.

We can also analyze another variable, CHECKUP1, which relates to annual checkups. Please refer to the step-by-step data analysis guide provided at the following link:

## Day 3 Activities
The Day 3 activities will include creating bar charts based on the frequency tables by race that we generated earlier.

## Day 4 Activities

Today, we'll enhance our chart analysis by integrating an additional layer: income level. This will allow us to observe how patterns in health outcomes vary depending on different income brackets.

First, we will focus on the heart attack experience by race, stratified by income level. You can find the R code and detailed steps for this process in the worksheet here:
https://drykim.github.io/SummerFX2025/day4_heart_income.html

Second, we will create charts to visualize annual check-up rates by race, also broken down by income level. The relevant R code and instructions are available in this worksheet: https://drykim.github.io/SummerFX2025/day4_checkup_income.html
