# SummerFX2025 Project

Welcome to the SummerFX2025 repository! This repository contains materials and exercises for our summer program.

## Day 1 Activities

On Day 1, we will begin by checking student understanding of racial disparities in health through a survey questionnaire. Please use the following link to answer the survey:
[Racial Health Disparities Survey](https://forms.gle/vgiRgibEWrwiT9oD6)

After the survey, I will introduce RStudio and walk through the introductory worksheet:
[R Introduction: Basic Coding and Practice](https://drykim.github.io/SummerFX2025/R_Intro.html)

Following my session, students will discuss health disparity issues further after reading the common findings:
[Common Findings on Racial Health Disparities](https://drykim.github.io/SummerFX2025/Common_Finding.html)

A research mentor will also be available to ensure every student can follow the R Intro, and can successfully import and create tables when given data and variable names.

## Day 2 Worksheet

The Day 2 worksheet will be used as the main worksheet for Day 2. You can access it here:
[Day 2 Worksheet (Live Page)](https://drykim.github.io/SummerFX2025/day2.html)

After you finish, you can analyze another variable, CVDINFR4, which indicates heart attack status. Please refer to the step-by-step guide for data analysis provided in the link.
